XML Creator

Packages Used

================================================================================

1. express --> To Create a Server
2. nodemon --> For developement purpose only, looks for changes in file
3. fs --> To access file system
4. path --> To join paths, in a simple manner: Can be ignored

================================================================================

So Now, The whole application is being rendered from server-side. Hence 'fs' is being run on server and hence able to manipulate file system.

Not Sure this would work in production, i.e., when it is hosted on a server. Need to look into that.
Might not access local file system, since this would be running on server.
